# Builder

Builder for Citizens2

Originally created by the Citizens team (jrbudda), now maintained by Citizens/Denizen team (mcmonkey and Morphan1)

### NOTICE:

I'm not realistically going to update this to 1.13

The code in this project is a trainwreck from the original developers not being very skilled at what they were doing... it's covered in code that was legacy at the time it was written, and is now even more legacy (for 1.13 rules) to the point of being unreasonable to even attempt updating. A realistic attempt at 'updating' this would actually just be rewriting it entirely to work with anything remotely modern, and ideally with better code the next time around. At time of writing, I don't have the interest/investment/time to bother making a new builder for 1.13. Sorry :/
